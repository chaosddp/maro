    "#### 3.1.1 Oracle Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to divide-and-conquer the four-node system, i.e, the left subsystem and the right subsystem. The insight is that the two subsystems exchange bikes of the same amount, controlled by the functions $F_{32}$ and $F_{01}$. This indicates that, if the initial bikes can already support the inner requirement loops in each subsystem, we can balance each subsystem separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the left subsystem $\\left\\{s_1, s_3\\right\\}$, the *outer system* gives bikes to $s_1$ and ask out from $s_3$. Therefore, the straight-forward approach is to move bikes from $s_1$ to $s_3$ with the same amount as that $s_1$ receives by the function $F_{01}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the right part, as the requirement curves $F_{20}$ and $F_{02}$ are with the period $20*\\pi$, we consider the policy in each half period. The first half period is really simple because only $s_0$ has requirements. Therefore, the right policy is to simply move all bikes from $s_2$ to $s_0$. In the second half period, as $s_0$ also gives bikes to $s_1$ by the function $F_{01}$, $s_0$ has to reserve a certain amount $R_{01}$ when sending its bikes to $s_2$, instead of send all its bikes to $s_2$ like $s_2$ does in the first half period. For simplicity, the reserved amount $R_{01}$ can be set to be constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implementation can be seen in 'RuleBasedPolicy' class below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.2 Policy Guided by Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the oracle policy solves the problem in simple rules and gains obvious improvement in performance, it is binded to the bike requirement functions. Here, I would like to give a more general solution without building upon the specific settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "For human beings, the most straight-forward strategy when they knows nothing about the latent requirement curves is to run the system for a while and see which station needs additional bikes. Similarly, I maintain a statistical variable to describe the extent to which one station is in lack of bikes. Each time a station needs bikes, I provide bikes from the station of the least shortage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the implementation, the statistical variable I use is the exponential moving average of the shortage of each station along the ticks. In addition, to prevent the same station being chosen for multiple times in a single tick, I add a penalty to the selected station, which will reduce its ranking in the latter selections."
